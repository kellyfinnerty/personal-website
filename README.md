# personal-website

This is the code for my personal website. The website has my contact info, resume, and projects I've worked on. In order to run the code, you must create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages.

To create a virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the code
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Now you can check out the website on a local host (http://127.0.0.1:8000/) !
